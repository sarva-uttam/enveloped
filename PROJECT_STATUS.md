# Enveloped — Project Status & Handoff Notes

Enveloped is an AI-crafted digital invite platform for weddings and events
(Next.js 16 App Router, Supabase backend, PayPal payments, multilingual UI).
This file exists so a fresh session picking up this repo has the context
that would otherwise only live in prior chat history.

**This is now the only working folder for this project.** The personal
portfolio (`uttam-torry-portfolio` / github.com/monsieur-zordi/uttam-torry-portfolio)
is a separate, unrelated site now managed by someone else — disregard it
when working here.

## What's built

- Landing page, dashboard, invite viewer, survey flow, templates, pricing,
  and how-it-works pages
- AI content generation via `src/app/api/generate/route.ts` (Vercel AI SDK)
- Supabase for storage (invites, RSVPs) — schema in `supabase/schema.sql`
- **PayPal payment gate**: an invite is preview-only (owner sees the design,
  guests see "not live yet") until it's paid, then guest links unlock
- **Auth & ownership**: Supabase Auth (email magic link) + a real
  `owner_id` on every invite. Creating invites, the dashboard, and owner
  previews all require sign-in; ownership is decided by comparing the
  signed-in user's id to `owner_id` — never by whether a `?guest=` param
  is present. See "Auth & ownership foundation" below for the full detail.
- **i18n**: a client-side language switcher in the navbar — English, French,
  Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kreol Morisien — currently covers the
  **navbar and hero only**
- Homepage shows tier names/descriptions but not prices; only `/pricing`
  shows dollar amounts
- AI-forward copy was intentionally toned down site-wide — the product is
  AI-generated but that isn't the headline pitch
- Per-invite Open Graph metadata so a shared link previews with a personal
  message instead of a generic URL/title

## Auth & ownership foundation

**What changed and why:** before this, `invites`/`invite_guests`/
`invite_rsvps` had fully public RLS policies (`using (true)`), and the app
decided who was the invite's "owner" by checking whether a `?guest=` query
param was *absent* from the URL — meaning anyone who stripped that param
off a shared guest link saw the owner's management panel, including every
other guest's name and personal link. This batch replaces both.

- **Auth**: Supabase Auth, email magic link (`supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`).
  `/login` requests the link; `/auth/callback` exchanges the code for a
  session. Client-side auth state lives in `AuthProvider`/`useAuth()`
  (`src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`), mirroring the existing `LocaleContext`
  pattern.
- **Ownership**: `invites.owner_id` (uuid, references `auth.users`,
  `default auth.uid()` so a client can never claim ownership on someone
  else's behalf). Ownership is resolved by the pure, unit-tested
  `resolveViewerRole()` in `src/lib/ownership.ts` — it only ever returns
  "owner" when `currentUserId === ownerId`, both non-null.
- **Enforced in three layers**: `src/proxy.ts` optimistically redirects
  unauthenticated `/dashboard` and `/survey` requests to `/login`; the app
  layer double-checks (`getMyInvites()` returns `[]` without a session,
  `saveInvite()` throws `NotAuthenticatedError`); Postgres RLS is the real
  boundary (`supabase/migrations/20260828000000_auth_ownership.sql`) —
  owner-only insert/update/delete on `invites`, owner-only read/write on
  `invite_guests`/`invite_rsvps`.
- **The raw `invites` table has NO public read policy at all — owner-only,
  full stop.** This went through two wrong drafts before landing here,
  worth recording so the reasoning doesn't get re-litigated or
  accidentally reverted:
  1. Original: `using (true)` unconditionally — an UNPAID invite's full
     content was sent to any caller; "This invite isn't live yet" only
     hid it in the UI, never withheld the data.
  2. First fix: `paid = true OR auth.uid() = owner_id` — closed #1, but
     still `select("*")`-shaped. `invites.answers` is the RAW SURVEY
     INPUT, which includes `guestNames` (the host's plain-text guest
     list — a duplicate of what `invite_guests` holds, but never
     protected the same way) plus `partnerNames`/`venue`/`city`/
     `colorMood`/`extraDetails`. A published invite would have shipped
     ALL of that to any guest, regardless of the `invite_guests`/
     `resolve_invite_guest()` lockdown described below — locking down
     one table while leaving a duplicate of the same data sitting
     unprotected in another column.
  3. **Current**: the raw table's only read policy is
     `auth.uid() = owner_id` (owner sees everything, as intended — "may
     still retrieve the full owner record"). Every non-owner read goes
     through `get_published_invite()` instead — a SECURITY DEFINER
     function returning a hand-picked column set (`id`, `slug`, `paid`,
     and — only when `paid = true` — `tier`, `content`, and the two
     `answers` keys the UI actually renders, `eventDate`/`song`, pulled
     via `->>'eventDate'`/`->>'song'`, never the whole `answers` object).
     Postgres RLS is row-level, not column-level, which is exactly why
     draft #2 couldn't be fixed as a table policy — a function that
     selects specific columns is the correct tool once "some columns
     public, others owner-only" is the requirement.
- A guest's own personalized name/teaser (from a `?guest=` link, only on
  a *published* invite) is resolved separately through
  `resolve_invite_guest()` — also fixed this round to add
  `and i.paid = true` to its own `where` clause; it previously had no
  paid check at all, so a guest link to an unpublished invite could still
  resolve a real name/teaser through that RPC even though the UI never
  displayed it for that case.
- `submitRsvp()` used to look up the invite via a direct
  `invites.select("id")` read, which broke once the raw table became
  owner-only (a guest, with no session, would get nothing back) — it now
  resolves the invite through `get_published_invite()` too, which also
  means RSVPs against an unpublished invite are refused outright now, not
  just hidden by the UI.
- **Client/server Supabase separation**: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
  (browser, anon key, RLS-respecting, cookie-based session via
  `@supabase/ssr`) vs. `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (server-only,
  reads the caller's session from cookies, still RLS-respecting) vs.
  `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` (server-only, service-role, bypasses RLS —
  guarded by the `server-only` package so it can never reach client code).
  The actual read logic (`fetchInvite`/`fetchGuestEntry`) lives once in
  the client-agnostic `src/lib/storage-queries.ts`, taking an injected
  client — `storage.ts` (browser) and `storage.server.ts` (server) are
  thin wrappers around it, so there's exactly one implementation per
  query, not two to keep in sync. Every server-side caller — the PayPal
  `orders` Route Handler, `generateMetadata`, and `markInvitePaid` — now
  goes through `storage.server.ts`; none of them touch the browser client
  anymore (an earlier version of this batch had the PayPal routes and
  `generateMetadata` calling storage.ts's browser-client-backed
  functions from server code, which worked for plain reads only by
  accident of how `@supabase/ssr`'s browser client degrades outside a
  real browser — fully replaced now, not patched).

## Pending — needs a human to do these, not just code

1. **Run the auth & ownership migration.**
   `supabase/migrations/20260828000000_auth_ownership.sql` has **not**
   been applied to the live database — until it is, invites have no
   `owner_id` column and the old fully-public RLS policies are still
   active (meaning the ownership bug this batch fixes at the app layer
   isn't yet closed at the database layer). Steps:
   - Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → paste the file's contents → Run.
   - Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.local` (Project Settings >
     API) — the PayPal capture route needs it now; it's already
     referenced (blank) in both `.env.local` and `.env.example`.
   - **Existing invites** (created before this batch) will have
     `owner_id = null` after the migration. They stay publicly viewable
     by guests (unchanged), but won't appear in anyone's dashboard and
     can't be edited/deleted by anyone — there's no account to
     retroactively attach them to. If any of those need to be reachable
     from a dashboard, that's a manual decision (e.g. a one-off script
     backfilling specific rows to a specific `owner_id`), not something
     to automate silently.
   - Confirm both `resolve_invite_guest` and `get_published_invite` show
     up under Database > Functions with `EXECUTE` granted to `anon` —
     between them, that's the entire non-owner read path (guest
     personalization, and the invite content itself) post-migration.
2. **Add PayPal credentials.** `.env.local` needs
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` from
   [developer.paypal.com/dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications)
   (start with a **Sandbox** app, not Live). Until set, the paywall
   correctly shows "Payments aren't available right now" rather than
   breaking. `PAYPAL_API_BASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_ENV` in
   `.env.example` document the sandbox→live switch.
3. **PayPal integrity — still deferred, next batch.** This batch
   deliberately did not touch *who* is allowed to trigger a PayPal
   capture or verify a payment actually happened — see REVIEW_BRIEF.md.
   `markInvitePaid` now runs through a proper service-role client instead
   of the old public policy (a client-separation fix), but its trust
   model — "the server can mark any invite paid after any successful
   capture call" — is unchanged.
4. **AI Gateway auth is unset.** `/api/generate` currently throws
   `GatewayAuthenticationError` in local dev — `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (or a
   direct provider key) isn't configured yet, so AI generation doesn't
   actually run end-to-end yet.
5. **i18n is partial by design so far** — only nav + hero are translated.
   Expanding further means adding keys to `src/lib/i18n/translations.ts`
   for each new section (steps, categories, tiers, dashboard, survey…),
   one section at a time.
6. **Translation review recommended.** French is fairly solid. Hindi,
   Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi are AI-translated but not native-reviewed.
   Kreol Morisien was supplied by the user via ChatGPT and looks
   consistent, but hasn't had a native-speaker check either — worth doing
   before real users see any of the five.
7. ~~Pre-existing lint debt~~ — **fixed.** `Countdown.tsx` and
   `PaywallPanel.tsx` now compute their initial state instead of setting
   it synchronously inside an effect; `LocaleContext.tsx` was rewritten to
   read `localStorage` via `useSyncExternalStore` instead of an
   effect+setState (the effect+setState version isn't safely fixable with
   a lazy `useState` initializer the way the other two were, since
   `window` doesn't exist during SSR — `useSyncExternalStore` is React's
   own tool for exactly this); `Footer.tsx`'s unescaped apostrophe is
   escaped. `npm run lint` is clean (exit 0).
8. **RLS is reviewed and covered by two kinds of test, still not
   integration-tested against real Postgres.** `src/lib/storage-queries.test.ts`
   tests the actual query logic (mocked client) both storage.ts and
   storage.server.ts share, including that `fetchPublicInvite()`'s return
   shape structurally has no room for `answers`/`owner_id`/
   `paypal_order_id` and that `submitRsvp` never touches the raw
   `invites` table; `src/lib/rls-policy.test.ts` is a text-pattern
   regression guard over the migration SQL itself, asserting the
   security-critical conditions (no public policy on the raw `invites`
   table at all; `get_published_invite()`'s body never references
   `guestnames`/`partnernames`/`extradetails`/`colormood`/`owner_id`/
   `paypal_order_id`, and only touches `answers` via `->>'eventdate'`/
   `->>'song'`; `resolve_invite_guest()` requires `paid = true`) are
   still present — it reads the SQL as text, it doesn't execute it, and
   says so in its own header comment. Neither replaces actually running
   this against a real (or local Docker) Postgres — `supabase start`
   locally, or `supabase test db` — before fully trusting it in
   production.
